# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the
election audit of a recent local congressional election

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Resources
Data Source: election results.csv
Software: Python 3.9.7, Visual Studio Code

## Results
The analysis of the election show that:\
There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.

### Votes per County:
Jefferson:  10.5% 38,855\
Denver:  82.8% 306,055\
Arapahoe:  6.7% 24,801

### The candidates were:
Charles Casper Stockham\
Diana DeGette\
Raymon Anthony Doane

### The candidate results were:
Charles Casper Stockham received 23% of the vote and 85,213 votes\
Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes\
Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 votes

### The winner of the election was:
Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 votes.

## Challenge Summary
WIth this code you should be able to use this with other elections with their CSV files. The only two things you should have to change is which file to load and which rows to use for candidate_name and county_name. As shown below.

With just changing those two elements of the code you would be able to use this code with any election with similar data.
